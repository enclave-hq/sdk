# 🗑️ KMS Legacy System Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Cleanup

### 1. **Model and Struct Cleanup** (`internal/models/models.go`)

- ❌ Delete `EncryptedPrivateKey` struct
- ❌ Delete `EncryptKeyRequest/Response`
- ❌ Delete `SignRequest/Response`
- ❌ Delete `GetAddressRequest/Response`
- ✅ Keep `DualLayerEncryptedKey` and related dual-layer encryption structures

### 2. **API Route Cleanup** (`internal/router/router.go`)

- ❌ Delete `POST /api/v1/encrypt`
- ❌ Delete `POST /api/v1/sign`
- ❌ Delete `POST /api/v1/get-address`
- ❌ Delete `POST /api/v1/sign/transaction`
- ✅ Keep `GET /api/v1/health`
- ✅ Keep `POST /api/v1/generate-key`
- 📋 Pending dual-layer encryption routes

## 🚧 Needs Continued Cleanup

### 3. **Service Method Cleanup** (`internal/services/kms_service.go`)

Need to delete the following methods:

- `EncryptPrivateKey()` - Legacy encryption method
- `SignData()` - Legacy signing method
- `GetAddress()` - Legacy address retrieval method
- `GetStoredKey()` - Method to query legacy table
- `GetStoredKeysWithEncryptedData()` - Get legacy table data

### 4. **Handler Cleanup**

- `internal/handlers/encrypt_handler.go` - Delete legacy encryption handler
- `internal/handlers/sign_handler.go` - Delete legacy signature handler

### 5. **Database Table Cleanup**

- Delete `encrypted_private_keys` table creation statement
- Update migration scripts, remove references to legacy table

### 6. **Documentation and Test Cleanup**

- Update API documentation, remove legacy interface descriptions
- Update test scripts, switch to use dual-layer encryption interface
- Update Postman Collection

## 🎯 KMS Architecture After Cleanup

### **Functions to Keep**

```
✅ HealthCheck:            GET  /api/v1/health
✅ KeyGenerate:            POST /api/v1/generate-key
✅ Dual-layer Encryption:  POST /api/v1/dual-layer/encrypt
✅ Dual-layer Signature:   POST /api/v1/dual-layer/sign
✅ Business Keys:          POST /api/v1/business/keys/*
✅ Data Encrypt/Decrypt:   POST /api/v1/data/encrypt|decrypt
```

### **Functions to Delete**

```
❌ Legacy Encryption:   POST /api/v1/encrypt
❌ Legacy Signature:    POST /api/v1/sign
❌ Legacy Address:      POST /api/v1/get-address
❌ Legacy Transaction:  POST /api/v1/sign/transaction
```

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Complete Service Method Cleanup** - Delete legacy methods in KMS Service
2. **Add Dual-layer Encryption Routes** - Enable dual-layer encryption API in router
3. **Cleanup Handler Files** - Delete unnecessary handler files
4. **Update Database Scripts** - Remove legacy table related SQL
5. **Test Verification** - Ensure dual-layer encryption functions work properly

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Ensure dual-layer encryption functions are fully available before deleting legacy methods
- Keep necessary audit logs and statistics functions
- Update all related documentation and test cases
